# weather_glider
This weather monitoring glider collects real-time temperature, humidity, and orientation data using an ESP32, DHT22, and MPU6050. Unlike weather balloons, it’s reusable, cost-effective, and can cover targeted paths. Data is transmitted over Wi-Fi and saved as CSV files for later analysis. The system includes onboard sensors, a custom-built glider, and live graph plotting via Python, making it ideal for short-range atmospheric research.
